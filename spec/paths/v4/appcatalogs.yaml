    #### About the Labels


    - `application.giantswarm.io/catalog-type`
      Describes the type of catalog.

      - `managed` - Apps in this catalog are managed by Giant Swarm.
      - `incubator` - Apps in this catalog are a work in progress. They're
                      made with your Giant Swarm cluster in mind though, so
                      they should work. Feedback is appreciated on these apps.
      - `test` - Apps in this catalog will soon graduate to incubator status,
                  you most likely will not see any `test` catalogs on your
                  installations.
      - `community` - Apps in this catalog are provided by the kubernetes
                      community. They will most likely not work without making
                      some changes to the security settings of your cluster.

      App Catalogs can also be labeled as `internal`, however these catalogs
      contain apps that run on our control planes. These `internal` app catalogs
      will be filtered out and never shown when calling this endpoint.
